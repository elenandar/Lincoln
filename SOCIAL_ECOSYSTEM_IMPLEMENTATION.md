# Social Ecosystem Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive social ecosystem to the Lincoln system, providing deeper simulation for school drama scenarios and implementing information access levels for better player immersion.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Information Access Levels

**Purpose:** Control what system information players see to maintain immersion and preserve story surprises.

**Components:**
- `L.playerInfoLevel` state (default: 'character')
- Modified `LC.lcSys()` to accept level parameter
- Filtering logic in Output.txt based on playerInfoLevel
- `/mode` command for switching between modes

**Modes:**
- **Character Mode (default):** Hides director-level messages for maximum immersion
- **Director Mode:** Shows all system messages including meta-information

**Files Modified:**
- Library v16.0.8.patched.txt
- Output v16.0.8.patched.txt

**Test Coverage:** test_access_levels.js (7 tests, all passing)

---

### 2. EnvironmentEngine

**Purpose:** Track and simulate environmental factors (weather, location, ambiance) with integration to character moods.

**Components:**
- `L.environment` state tracking
- Location detection (9 location types, bilingual)
- Weather system (6 weather types)
- Weather-mood integration (20% probability)
- `/weather` and `/location` commands

**Features:**
- Automatic location detection from narrative text
- Weather changes affect character moods probabilistically
- All system messages use director-level access

**Weather Types:**
- clear (‚òÄÔ∏è), rain (üåßÔ∏è), snow (‚ùÑÔ∏è), storm (‚õàÔ∏è), fog (üå´Ô∏è), cloudy (‚òÅÔ∏è)

**Recognized Locations:**
- Classroom, Cafeteria, Gym, Library, Hallway, Schoolyard, Park, Home, Street

**Files Modified:**
- Library v16.0.8.patched.txt

**Test Coverage:** test_environment.js (10 tests, all passing)

---

### 3. GossipEngine

**Purpose:** Create dynamic social ecosystem through rumors, reputation, and gossip propagation.

**Components:**

#### Observer Sub-Module
- Detects gossip-worthy events (romance, conflict, betrayal, achievement)
- Generates rumors with witness tracking
- Applies "Interpretation Matrix" based on witness-subject relationships

#### Propagator Sub-Module
- Spreads rumors between characters
- Adds distortion with each spread (30% chance)
- Updates reputation based on rumor type and spin
- Auto-propagates when characters interact (20% chance)

**State Structures:**
```javascript
L.rumors = [{
  id: 'rumor_...',
  text: '...',
  type: 'romance|conflict|betrayal|achievement',
  subject: 'Character',
  target: 'Character2',
  spin: 'positive|neutral|negative',
  turn: 10,
  knownBy: ['Witness1', 'Witness2'],
  distortion: 0.5,
  verified: false
}]

L.characters[name].reputation = 0-100
```

**Commands:**
- `/rumor` - List, add, or spread rumors
- `/reputation` - View or set character reputations

**Reputation Effects:**
- Romance: +2 (positive) or -1 (negative)
- Conflict: -3
- Betrayal: -5
- Achievement: +5
- Distortion penalty: -floor(distortion)

**Files Modified:**
- Library v16.0.8.patched.txt

**Test Coverage:** test_gossip.js (12 tests, all passing)

## Integration Points

### UnifiedAnalyzer
All three engines are integrated into the UnifiedAnalyzer pipeline:
```
Output ‚Üí UnifiedAnalyzer
  ‚Üì LC.MoodEngine.analyze()
  ‚Üì LC.EnvironmentEngine.analyze()
  ‚Üì LC.GossipEngine.analyze()
  ‚Üì LC.RelationsEngine.analyze()
```

### Cross-Engine Integration
- **EnvironmentEngine ‚Üî MoodEngine:** Weather affects character moods
- **GossipEngine ‚Üî RelationsEngine:** Interpretation matrix uses relationship values
- **GossipEngine ‚Üî EvergreenEngine:** Character importance validation

## Documentation

### SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md Updates

Added three major sections:
- **Section 3.5:** Information Access Levels (complete with examples)
- **Section 3.6:** Environment Simulation (architecture, commands, examples)
- **Section 3.7:** Social Simulation (Observer/Propagator, reputation, examples)

Total additions: ~470 lines of comprehensive documentation including:
- Overview and purpose

## Implementation Notes

### Director-Level Messages
All engine system messages use director-level access:
```javascript
LC.lcSys({ text: "Meta information", level: 'director' });
```

This ensures:
- Character mode hides simulation mechanics
- Director mode shows all engine activity
- Default experience preserves immersion

### Probabilistic Systems
Several systems use probability for realism:
- Weather mood effects: 20% chance
- Rumor distortion: 30% chance per spread
- Auto-propagation: 20% chance per interaction

### Character Validation
GossipEngine uses EvergreenEngine for:
- Character name normalization
- Character importance validation
- Active character tracking (lastSeen within 2 turns)

### State Version Management
All engines properly increment `L.stateVersion` to invalidate context cache when state changes.

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

**Information Access Levels:**
- Custom message levels beyond director/character
- Per-engine level controls
- Message history filtering

**EnvironmentEngine:**
- More location types
- Ambient sounds/music
- Time-of-day lighting effects
- Seasonal changes

**GossipEngine:**
- Rumor verification mechanics
- Rumor expiration/decay
- Faction/group-based reputation
- Social circles/cliques
- Rumor mutation (not just distortion)

---

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- `lcSys()` still accepts string messages
- `lcConsumeMsgs()` normalizes both formats
- Existing tests all pass
- No breaking changes to API

---

## Performance Impact

- Minimal: All engines use efficient pattern matching
- Context caching: State version properly incremented
- Probabilistic systems: Reduce computational overhead
- No performance regression detected in existing tests

---
