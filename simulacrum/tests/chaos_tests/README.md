# Chaos Tests - Protocol '–¶–µ—Ä–±–µ—Ä'

## Overview

This directory contains chaos testing scenarios for validating system resilience against destructive user action patterns. These tests implement "–ü—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª '–¶–µ—Ä–±–µ—Ä', –ß–∞—Å—Ç—å 2 ‚Äî –ò—Å–ø—ã—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ –•–∞–æ—Å–æ–º" (Cerberus Protocol, Part 2 - Chaos Testing).

## Test Files

### test_chaos_scenarios.js

Validates system behavior under two critical chaos scenarios:

#### 1. Retry Storm
- **Scenario**: User performs 10 consecutive retry actions
- **Purpose**: Validate that the system remains stable under retry spam
- **Checks**:
  - Turn counter doesn't go backwards
  - History is correctly managed (cleared by retries)
  - No inappropriate recap offers during retries
  - System remains responsive after the storm

#### 2. Erase+Continue
- **Scenario**: User makes two actions, erases one, then continues
- **Purpose**: Ensure context integrity and prevent system data leakage
- **Checks**:
  - Erase correctly removes history entries
  - Turn counter decrements appropriately
  - Continue doesn't modify history
  - AI context is properly formatted (no naked system data)
  - No leakage of internal state like `[Mood: neutral]` or `currentAction: {`

## Running the Tests

```bash
# From repository root
node simulacrum/tests/chaos_tests/test_chaos_scenarios.js

# Or as executable
./simulacrum/tests/chaos_tests/test_chaos_scenarios.js
```

## Expected Output

When all tests pass:
```
‚úÖ ALL CHAOS TESTS PASSED

Protocol '–¶–µ—Ä–±–µ—Ä' validation complete:
  ‚úì System withstands retry storm (10 consecutive retries)
  ‚úì Turn counter remains stable during retry storm
  ‚úì No inappropriate recap offers during retries
  ‚úì Erase+Continue maintains context integrity
  ‚úì No system data leakage in AI context

System is resilient against chaos scenarios! üõ°Ô∏è
```

## Implementation Notes

- These tests use the Project Simulacrum test harness (`simulacrum/test_harness.js`)
- The Input script may convert empty retry actions to continue actions - this is expected behavior
- Tests verify that system data doesn't leak into the AI context in naked form (e.g., `[Mood: neutral]`)
- Proper formatting uses tags like `‚ü¶MOOD‚üß` instead of raw system data
