## Task 2: Dynamic Stress Test (DYNAMIC_STRESS_TEST_REPORT_V7.md)

**Script:** `node tests/dynamic_stress_test.js`  
**Duration:** 2500 turns  
**Output:** `DYNAMIC_STRESS_TEST_REPORT_V7.md` (355 lines, 8.9KB)

### Key Results:

#### 1. Memory Leak Confirmation ⚠️
**CONFIRMED:** Significant non-plateauing state size growth detected

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Initial state size | 10,342 bytes |
| Final state size | 106,787 bytes |
| Growth ratio | **10.33x** |
| Status | ⚠️ EXCESSIVE GROWTH |

**Growth Pattern:**
- Turn 50: 10,342 bytes
- Turn 500: 28,659 bytes (2.77x)
- Turn 1000: 48,442 bytes (4.68x)
- Turn 1500: 70,173 bytes (6.79x)
- Turn 2000: 89,796 bytes (8.68x)
- Turn 2500: 106,787 bytes (10.33x)

The growth shows clear linear expansion without plateau, consistent with unbounded accumulation of data (such as grades in `L.academics.grades`).

#### 2. System Stability
- **Consciousness Resilience:** ✅ PASS
  - Panic test: STABLE
  - Euphoria test: STABLE  
  - Paranoia test: STABLE
  
- **Garbage Collection:** ✅ WORKING
  - Rumor management under control
  - Max rumors: 149 (within RUMOR_HARD_CAP buffer)

- **LoreEngine:** ✅ OPERATIONAL
  - 4 legends generated organically
  - Event types: conflict, betrayal, public_humiliation, romance

#### 3. Character Status
- All 7 characters remained ACTIVE throughout 2500 turns
- No freezing or status degradation

## AcademicsEngine Verification Notes

### Evidence to Look For (For Your Analysis):

The dynamic stress test invokes `LC.LivingWorld.runOffScreenCycle()` every 200 turns (at turns 200, 400, 600, etc.), totaling ~12 time jumps during the 2500-turn simulation.

According to the Library code (lines 5596-5617), each time jump has a 20% probability of triggering an academic test event, which would:
1. Call `LC.AcademicsEngine.calculateGrade()` for each active character
2. Call `LC.AcademicsEngine.recordGrade()` to store the grade in `L.academics.grades[name][subject][]`
3. Potentially trigger `MoodEngine.analyze()` for exceptional grades
4. Potentially create lore entries for dramatic academic events

Expected number of academic events: ~12 time jumps × 0.20 probability × 7 characters = **~16-17 grade recordings**

### Memory Leak Source Hypothesis:

The 10.33x state growth is likely coming from multiple sources:
- **Rumors array:** Growing from 13 to 147 items (but managed by GC)
- **L.academics.grades:** Unbounded accumulation of grade entries (each with grade + turn)
- **Goals:** Academic goals generated via `GoalsEngine.generateAcademicGoals()`
- **Lore entries:** Legends and historical events

The grades accumulation is particularly significant because:
- Each grade entry is `{grade: number, turn: number}`
- No cleanup/archival mechanism exists for old grades
- Grades accumulate indefinitely per character per subject
- With 7 characters × 4 subjects × ~2-3 tests = **~56-84 grade entries** expected

### To Verify in Your Analysis:

1. Check the actual state snapshot for presence of `L.academics.grades` structure
2. Examine if grade counts correlate with memory growth
3. Verify MoodEngine triggered for high/low grades
4. Look for academic-related tags in character status (e.g., "Отличник")
5. Check if any lore entries have type "ACADEMIC_TRIUMPH" or "ACADEMIC_DISGRACE"

## Scripts Modified

1. **tests/comprehensive_audit.js**
   - Added console output capture mechanism
   - Now saves complete audit output to `FINAL_STATIC_AUDIT_V7.md`

2. **tests/dynamic_stress_test.js**
   - Updated report filename from `V4` to `V7`
   - No functional changes to test execution

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Both audit tasks completed successfully**

The reports confirm:
1. **Static Analysis:** System is in excellent condition (100% score)
2. **Dynamic Analysis:** Significant memory leak detected (10.33x growth over 2500 turns)
3. **System Stability:** Core engines functioning correctly despite memory growth

The reports are now available for your detailed analysis to:
- Verify AcademicsEngine integration traces
- Confirm the memory leak characteristics
- Assess correlation between GPA and social status
- Evaluate grade impact on character mood

Both report files have been committed to the repository and are ready for review.
