## Critical Path Analysis

**Longest dependency chain (cannot be parallelized):**

```
Phase 0 (0.5d) 
  ‚Üì
Phase 1 (2.5d avg) 
  ‚Üì
Phase 2 (2d avg)
  ‚Üì
Phase 3 (2.5d avg)
  ‚Üì
Phase 4 (5.5d avg) ‚Üê CRITICAL BOTTLENECK
  ‚Üì
Phase 5 (3.75d avg)
  ‚Üì
Phase 6 (3.25d avg)
  ‚Üì
Phase 7 (3.25d avg)
  ‚Üì
Phase 8 (4d avg)

TOTAL: ~27 days (~5.5 weeks)
```

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. ‚úÖ Phase 4 must be completed without interruption
2. ‚úÖ QualiaEngine ‚Üí InformationEngine must be consecutive
3. ‚úÖ Do not proceed to Phase 5 until Phase 4 integration verified
4. ‚úÖ Test after every component
5. ‚úÖ Maintain ES5 compliance throughout
