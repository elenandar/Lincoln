# QualiaEngine Integration Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Issue:** Bug: Fix QualiaEngine Integration (The Heartbeat Protocol)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Problem Statement

Dynamic stress testing revealed that the `qualia_state` of characters (somatic_tension, valence) was not changing in response to positive or negative events. The QualiaEngine, which is the foundational consciousness simulation engine, was not integrated into the event processing cycle. Characters were not "feeling" the world, making the entire psychological model non-functional.

## Root Cause

The QualiaEngine's `resonate()` function was implemented but never called during event processing. Events were being detected and processed by various engines (EvergreenEngine, RelationsEngine, MoodEngine) but without triggering the phenomenal/bodily sensations that should precede cognitive interpretation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. EvergreenEngine Integration (Relation-Based Events)

**Location:** `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt`, lines 2668-2724

**Changes:**
- Extended relation verb patterns to include insults, threats, praise, etc.
- Added QualiaEngine.resonate() calls immediately after relation updates
- Both the actor and target of social actions now experience qualia changes
- Proper event type mapping (insult, threat, compliment, praise, etc.)

**New Verbs Added:**
- Negative: `оскорбил`, `унизил`, `угрожал`, `раскритиковал`
- Positive: `поддержал`, `похвалил`, `защитил`

**Example:**
```javascript
// After relation is updated
if (LC.QualiaEngine && typeof LC.QualiaEngine.resonate === 'function') {
  // Target receives the action
  LC.QualiaEngine.resonate(counterpartChar, {
    type: 'social',
    action: 'insult',  // mapped from verb
    actor: subject,
    target: counterpart,
    intensity: Math.min(1, Math.abs(modifier) / 15)
  });
}
```

### 2. MoodEngine Integration (Generic Events)

**Location:** `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt`, lines 4094-4173

**Changes:**
- Added QualiaEngine.resonate() calls when moods are detected
- Added generic positive/negative event patterns that don't require specific actors
- Mood-to-qualia mapping for emotions like angry, happy, scared, etc.

**New Generic Event Patterns:**
- Positive: "получил комплимент", "был похвален", "добился успеха", "получил подарок"
- Negative: "был унижен", "получил угрозу", "обнаружил предательство"

**Mood Mapping:**
```javascript
const moodToEventMap = {
  'angry': { type: 'social', action: 'criticism', intensity: 0.7 },
  'happy': { type: 'social', action: 'praise', intensity: 0.6 },
  'scared': { type: 'environmental', action: 'loud_noise', intensity: 0.8 },
  'offended': { type: 'social', action: 'insult', intensity: 0.6 },
  // ... etc
};
```

### 3. LivingWorld Integration

**Status:** Already implemented (no changes needed)

The LivingWorld.generateFact() function already had QualiaEngine integration for off-screen social events (lines 5198-5223 for SOCIAL_NEGATIVE, 5277-5300 for SOCIAL_POSITIVE).

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
- **Panic Test (20 negative events):**
  - Tension: 0.30 → 0.30 (no change ❌)
  - Valence: 0.50 → 0.50 (no change ❌)

- **Euphoria Test (20 positive events):**
  - Valence: 0.50 → 0.50 (no change ❌)

### After Fix:
- **Panic Test (20 negative events):**
  - Tension: 0.30 → 1.00 (increased ✅)
  - Valence: 0.50 → 0.00 (decreased ✅)

- **Euphoria Test (20 positive events):**
  - Valence: 0.50 → 1.00 (increased ✅)

### All Existing Tests:
- ✅ test_qualia_engine.js (10/10 tests pass)
- ✅ test_living_world.js (12/12 tests pass)
- ✅ test_integration_subjective_livingworld.js (3/3 tests pass)
- ✅ dynamic_stress_test.js (all stability tests pass)

## Architecture Principle

The implementation follows the principle stated in the issue:

> "Событие должно сначала вызывать 'ощущение' и только потом — 'мысль'."
> (An event should first trigger a 'sensation' and only then a 'thought'.)

The QualiaEngine.resonate() calls now happen:
1. **Immediately** after event detection
2. **Before** higher-level cognitive processing
3. **For both** real-time and off-screen events

## Impact

Characters now have a functioning "phenomenal core" that:
- Responds to social interactions with bodily sensations
- Experiences emotional states (tension, valence, focus, energy)
- Provides a foundation for all higher-level psychological processes
- Creates realistic emotional dynamics and feedback loops

The "heartbeat" of the consciousness simulation is now connected and functioning.
