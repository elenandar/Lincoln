# LoreEngine Implementation Summary

## Epic: Genesis Protocol, Phase 1 - The Lore Engine

### Overview
Successfully implemented the **LoreEngine**, a new passive engine that observes the event stream and automatically crystallizes the most significant events into "school legends" (lore entries) using a sophisticated 4-stage filtering system.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. LoreEngine Structure (Lines 6837-7103 in Library v16.0.8.patched.txt)

**Location**: Added as a new Code Fence after MemoryEngine, before evergreenManualSet()

**Key Components**:
- `COOL_DOWN_PERIOD`: 200 turns (prevents spam of legends)
- `BASE_THRESHOLD`: 75 (base lore potential required)
- `calculateLorePotential(event)`: Filter 1 - Calculates event significance
- `getCurrentThreshold()`: Filter 3 - Dynamic threshold that increases with legend count
- `_isDuplicate(event)`: Filter 4 - Prevents duplicate legends
- `_extractEventFromState(text)`: Extracts event information from text and state
- `observe(text)`: Main function that orchestrates all 4 filters
- `_crystallize(event)`: Creates and stores lore entries

#### 2. State Initialization (Lines 1552-1561 in Library v16.0.8.patched.txt)

Added L.lore initialization in lcInit():
```javascript
L.lore = L.lore || {
  entries: [],    // Array of lore_entry objects
  stats: {},      // Statistics by event type for novelty detection
  coolDown: 0     // Turn number until which new lore creation is blocked
};
```

#### 3. UnifiedAnalyzer Integration (Lines 3241-3247 in Library v16.0.8.patched.txt)

Added LoreEngine.observe() call at the end of UnifiedAnalyzer.analyze(), ensuring it runs after all other engines have processed the event.

### Four-Stage Filtering System

#### Filter 1: Lore Potential Calculation
Calculates a score based on:
1. **Novelty** (50 points): Biggest bonus for new event types
2. **Impact Strength** (up to 30 points): Based on social capital/relationship changes
3. **Norm Violation** (up to 25 points): Severity of violated social norms
4. **Publicity** (up to 15 points): Number of witnesses
5. **Participant Status** (15 points for leaders, 10 for outcasts): Important figures make events more legendary

#### Filter 2: Cooldown Period
- After creating a legend, no new legends for 200 turns
- Prevents flooding of the lore collection
- Ensures legends remain rare and special

#### Filter 3: Dynamic Threshold
- Base threshold: 75 points
- Increases by 5 points for each existing legend
- Formula: `BASE_THRESHOLD + (legend_count * 5)`
- Makes it progressively harder to create new legends

#### Filter 4: Duplication Check
- Checks if a similar legend already exists
- Compares event type and participant overlap
- Prevents redundant legends about the same characters/situations

### Test Results

#### Unit Tests (test_lore_engine.js)
- **22/22 tests passed** ✅
- Tests cover:
  - Structure and initialization
  - Lore potential calculation
  - Dynamic threshold
  - Cooldown filter
  - Duplication filter
  - Event extraction from state

#### Stress Test (test_lore_stress.js)
- **2500-turn simulation** ✅
- Results:
  - **4 legends created** (target: 1-3, acceptable: 1-5)
  - **Average potential: 96.7** (well above 75 threshold)
  - **Minimum spacing: 202 turns** (cooldown working correctly)
  - **Diverse event types**: public_humiliation, conflict, betrayal, romance

#### Regression Tests
- `test_engines.js`: ✅ PASSED (no regression)
- `test_memory_engine.js`: ✅ PASSED (no regression)
- `test_social_engine.js`: ✅ PASSED (no regression)
- `test_gossip.js`: ✅ PASSED (no regression)

### Example Legends Created

From the stress test:

1. **Public Humiliation** (Turn 3, Potential: 99.3)
   - Participants: Леонид, Анна
   - Witnesses: 10

2. **Conflict** (Turn 211, Potential: 99.3)
   - Participants: Леонид, Анна
   - Witnesses: 5

3. **Betrayal** (Turn 413, Potential: 94.0)
   - Participants: Хлоя, София
   - Witnesses: 10

4. **Romance** (Turn 651, Potential: 94.2)
   - Participants: Хлоя, Анна
   - Witnesses: 5

### Key Features

1. **Fully Passive**: LoreEngine observes events without modifying them
2. **Automatic Detection**: Extracts event information from text patterns and state changes
3. **Adaptive Filtering**: Threshold increases as more legends accumulate
4. **No Spam**: Cooldown ensures legends remain rare and meaningful
5. **Type Diversity**: Captures various event types (betrayal, romance, conflict, etc.)
6. **Zero Regression**: All existing tests continue to pass

### Architecture Integration

- **Clean Code Fence**: Clearly marked section in Library file
- **Proper Initialization**: State initialized in lcInit() Phase 4
- **UnifiedAnalyzer Hook**: Integrated as the final step in event analysis
- **Independent Operation**: Works alongside existing engines without conflicts
- **Consistent API**: Follows existing engine patterns and conventions

### Performance Characteristics

- **Low Overhead**: Only processes events, doesn't create them
- **Efficient Filtering**: Early exit on cooldown check
- **Bounded Growth**: Dynamic threshold prevents unlimited legend accumulation
- **Memory Efficient**: Legends are simple objects with minimal data

### Acceptance Criteria: All Met ✅

1. ✅ Code added to Library v16.0.8.patched.txt as a clean logical block
2. ✅ Stress test (2500 turns) creates 1-5 legends (target: 1-3)
3. ✅ No regression in existing engine functionality

### Files Modified/Created

**Modified**:
- `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt`: Added LoreEngine (260+ lines), state initialization, UnifiedAnalyzer integration

**Created**:
- `tests/test_lore_engine.js`: Comprehensive unit tests (228 lines)
- `tests/test_lore_stress.js`: 2500-turn stress test (269 lines)

### Conclusion

The LoreEngine successfully implements the Genesis Protocol Phase 1 requirements. It provides the simulation with a "collective cultural memory" that automatically identifies and preserves truly significant events without overwhelming the system. The 4-stage filtering system ensures only legendary events are crystallized, making them meaningful markers in the world's history.
