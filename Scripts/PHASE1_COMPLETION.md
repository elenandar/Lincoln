- **Architecture:** Modifier pattern for AI Dungeon hooks
- **Execution Model:** Library runs 3x per turn, state persists
- **Error Strategy:** Try-catch with graceful fallbacks everywhere
- **State Management:** Centralized in state.lincoln with versioning
- **Testing:** Comprehensive suite with 99 tests

### File Statistics

## Verification Commands

To verify Phase 1 implementation in AI Dungeon:

```
/ping          → Should respond with "Pong! Lincoln v17.0.0-phase1"
/help          → Should list 6 commands
/debug         → Should show version 17.0.0 and system info
/turn          → Should show current turn number
/action        → Should show current action type
/test-phase1   → Should run 8 infrastructure tests
```

To run automated tests locally:

```bash
cd Scripts
node test-phase1.js
```

Expected: All 99 tests pass (100% success rate)
