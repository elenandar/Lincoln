# Self-Concept Feature - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the "Я-Концепция" (Self-Concept) feature as specified in Тикет 3, evolving CrucibleEngine to version 2.0.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Core Implementation ✅

**File**: `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt`

- **Self-Concept Initialization** (lines 1904-1913)
  - All characters now receive `self_concept` object during creation
  - Initially matches `personality` for aligned self-awareness
  
- **CrucibleEngine 2.0** (lines 5367-5510)
  - Formative events primarily change self-concept (2.5-3x stronger than personality)
  - Supports betrayal, rescue, success, failure, and public humiliation
  - All event handlers updated with self-concept evolution
  
- **Context Overlay Integration** (lines 6823-6963)
  - AI sees characters through their self-concept when divergence exists
  - CONFLICT tags appear when gap exceeds 0.2
  - TRAITS tags use perceived values instead of objective ones

### 2. Testing ✅

**File**: `tests/test_self_concept.js` (370 lines)

Six comprehensive tests covering:
1. Self-concept initialization
2. Evolution ratios (self-concept changes more)
3. Internal conflict detection
4. Context overlay integration
5. Goal success effects
6. Public humiliation effects

**Results**: All tests pass ✅

**Backward Compatibility**: All existing Crucible tests pass ✅

- Two characters experiencing formative events
- Gap between objective traits and self-perception
- Context overlay showing traits and conflicts

## Technical Details

### Data Structure

```javascript
character: {
  personality: {           // Objective reality
    trust: 0.6,
    bravery: 0.7,
    idealism: 0.5,
    aggression: 0.3
  },
  self_concept: {          // Perceived reality
    perceived_trust: 0.4,
    perceived_bravery: 0.5,
    perceived_idealism: 0.3,
    perceived_aggression: 0.4
  }
}
```

### Evolution Ratios

| Event Type | Self-Concept | Objective | Ratio |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Betrayal (trust) | -0.25 | -0.10 | 2.5x |
| Rescue (trust) | +0.20 | +0.08 | 2.5x |
| Success (bravery) | +0.15 | +0.05 | 3.0x |
| Failure (idealism) | -0.15 | -0.05 | 3.0x |
| Humiliation (trust) | -0.15 | -0.05 | 3.0x |

**Average**: Self-concept changes ~2.8x more than objective personality

### Context Tags

**TRAITS** (Priority 730):
```
⟦TRAITS: Иван⟧ циничен и не доверяет людям
```
Based on `perceived_trust` when divergence detected.

**CONFLICT** (Priority 735):
```
⟦CONFLICT: Иван⟧ Внутренний конфликт: недооценивает свою доверчивость
```
Appears when `|personality.trait - self_concept.perceived_trait| > 0.2`

## Verification

### Test Results

```bash
# Self-concept tests
✅ Test 1: Self-Concept Initialization
✅ Test 2: Self-Concept Changes More Than Objective Personality
✅ Test 3: Internal Conflict from Self-Concept Divergence
✅ Test 4: Context Overlay Shows Self-Concept Traits and Conflict
✅ Test 5: Goal Success Primarily Affects Self-Concept
✅ Test 6: Public Humiliation Damages Self-Concept More

# Backward compatibility
✅ All 9 existing Crucible tests pass
✅ Existing demo works correctly
```

## How It Addresses the Issue

### Тикет 3 Requirements

**✅ Задача 1: Внедрение "Я-Концепции"**
- Implemented `self_concept` object with all four traits
- Initialized alongside personality during character creation
- Tracks perceived vs. objective traits

**✅ Задача 2: Эволюция Самооценки**
- CrucibleEngine now prioritizes self-concept changes
- Betrayal affects `perceived_trust` more than `trust`
- Success affects `perceived_bravery` more than `bravery`
- Public humiliation affects `perceived_trust` and `perceived_bravery`

**✅ Задача 3: Влияние "Я-Концепции" на Поведение**
- Context overlay shows self-concept to AI
- CONFLICT tags inform AI of internal struggles
- Characters act based on perceived traits when divergence exists
- Example: High objective bravery + low perceived bravery = cautious behavior with potential

### Example from Demo

**Мария after betrayal:**
```
Objective:   trust: 0.60 (still fairly trusting)
Perceived:   trust: 0.45 (sees self as cynical)
Gap:         -0.15 (underestimates capacity to trust)
```

**Context shows:**
```
⟦TRAITS: Мария⟧ циничен и не доверяет людям
```
AI portrays her as cynical based on self-perception, not reality.

## Philosophy

The implementation is grounded in psychological research showing:

1. **Trauma affects self-esteem more than core traits** - A betrayal may not fundamentally change who you are, but it drastically changes how you see yourself
2. **Self-fulfilling prophecy** - Believing you're a coward makes you act like one, even if you're objectively brave
3. **Impostor syndrome** - Success can create inflated self-confidence that exceeds actual capability

This creates **psychological depth** and **character arcs** about:
- Self-discovery (learning who you really are)
- Overcoming self-doubt (aligning perception with reality)
- Confronting inflated egos (reality humbling overconfidence)

## Future Enhancements

While not required for this ticket, the system enables:

1. **Self-Concept Drift**: Gradual alignment toward reality over time
2. **Social Support**: Friends helping improve self-perception
3. **Therapy Mechanics**: Events that increase self-awareness
4. **LivingWorld Integration**: Decisions based on perceived traits
5. **Dialogue Integration**: Characters referencing their self-doubt

## Conclusion

The Self-Concept feature successfully implements CrucibleEngine 2.0, adding psychological depth to character evolution. Characters now have rich inner lives where formative events shape not just who they are, but who they **believe** themselves to be.

**Key Innovation**: The gap between objective reality and self-perception creates internal conflict that drives compelling character arcs.

**Philosophy**: *"We are shaped not by what happens to us, but by what we believe happened to us."*
