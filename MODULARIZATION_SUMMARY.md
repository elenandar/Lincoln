# Modularization of Library.txt - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the refactoring of `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt` to modularize the codebase by creating separate engine objects for different functional areas.

## Changes Made

### 1. LC.GoalsEngine
**Purpose**: Handles goal detection and tracking logic.

**Location**: Library v16.0.8.patched.txt, lines ~2166-2221

**Methods**:
- `analyze(text, actionType)`: Analyzes text to extract character goals

**Implementation Details**:
- Moved logic from `LC.autoEvergreen.analyzeForGoals()` into this new engine
- Uses patterns from `LC.EvergreenEngine` (formerly `LC.autoEvergreen`)
- Detects goals in Russian and English
- Stores goals in `L.goals` with character, text, status, and turnCreated

**Backward Compatibility**:
- `LC.autoEvergreen.analyzeForGoals()` now delegates to `LC.GoalsEngine.analyze()`

### 2. LC.RelationsEngine
**Purpose**: Handles relationship tracking between characters.

**Location**: Library v16.0.8.patched.txt, lines ~2223-2335

**Properties**:
- `MODIFIERS`: Object containing relationship modifiers for different event types
  - `romance: 15`
  - `conflict: -10`
  - `betrayal: -25`
  - `loyalty: 10`

**Methods**:
- `analyze(text)`: Analyzes text to update character relationships based on detected events

**Implementation Details**:
- Extracts relationship logic from `LC.analyzeTextForEvents()`
- Uses event patterns to detect relationship-affecting events
- Updates numeric relationship values in `L.evergreen.relations`
- Relationship values range from -100 to 100 with default starting at 50

**Backward Compatibility**:
- `CONFIG.RELATIONSHIP_MODIFIERS` still exists and is synced with `LC.RelationsEngine.MODIFIERS`
- `LC.analyzeTextForEvents()` now delegates relationship analysis to `LC.RelationsEngine.analyze()`

### 3. LC.EvergreenEngine
**Purpose**: Main evergreen content tracking (previously `LC.autoEvergreen`).

**Location**: Library v16.0.8.patched.txt, lines ~1433-2165

**Methods** (unchanged from original):
- `_buildPatterns()`: Builds regex patterns for content detection
- `analyze(text, actionType)`: Main analysis method for evergreen content
- `normalizeCharName(name)`: Normalizes character names using aliases
- `isImportantCharacter(name)`: Checks if character is in core character list
- `limitCategories(L)`: Limits category sizes to prevent unbounded growth
- `getCanon()`: Returns canonical evergreen state as formatted text
- `getSummary()`: Returns summary of evergreen state
- `toggle(on)`: Enables/disables evergreen tracking
- `clear()`: Clears all evergreen data
- `analyzeForGoals(text, actionType)`: Delegates to `LC.GoalsEngine.analyze()`

**Backward Compatibility**:
- `LC.autoEvergreen` is now an alias pointing to `LC.EvergreenEngine`
- All existing references to `LC.autoEvergreen` continue to work

## Migration Guide

### For Code Using These APIs

**Old Code**:
```javascript
LC.autoEvergreen.analyzeForGoals(text, actionType);
LC.autoEvergreen.analyze(text, actionType);
```

**New Code** (preferred):
```javascript
LC.GoalsEngine.analyze(text, actionType);
LC.EvergreenEngine.analyze(text, actionType);
LC.RelationsEngine.analyze(text);
```

**Old Code** (still works):
```javascript
const modifier = CONFIG.RELATIONSHIP_MODIFIERS.romance;
```

**New Code** (preferred):
```javascript
const modifier = LC.RelationsEngine.MODIFIERS.romance;
```

### Breaking Changes
**None**. All changes are backward compatible.

## Testing

### Test Coverage
1. **test_goals.js**: Validates goal tracking functionality (all tests pass)
2. **test_engines.js**: Validates modular engine structure (all tests pass)

### Test Results
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ LC.GoalsEngine works correctly
- ✅ LC.RelationsEngine works correctly  
- ✅ LC.EvergreenEngine works correctly
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for all old APIs

## Benefits

1. **Better Code Organization**: Related logic is grouped into logical modules
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Each engine can be modified independently
3. **Clearer Responsibilities**: Each engine has a well-defined purpose
4. **Improved Testability**: Engines can be tested in isolation
5. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Complete backward compatibility maintained

## Files Modified

1. `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt`: Main refactoring
   - Created `LC.GoalsEngine`
   - Created `LC.RelationsEngine`
   - Renamed `LC.autoEvergreen` to `LC.EvergreenEngine`
   - Added backward compatibility aliases
   - Updated `LC.analyzeTextForEvents()` to use `LC.RelationsEngine`

2. `test_engines.js`: New test file to validate modular structure

## Future Enhancements

The modular structure enables future improvements:
- Each engine can have its own configuration
- Engines can be extended with additional methods
- New engines can be added following the same pattern
- Engine implementations can be swapped or enhanced independently
