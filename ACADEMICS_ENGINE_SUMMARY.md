# AcademicsEngine Implementation Summary (Bell Curve Phase 1)

## Overview
Successfully implemented the AcademicsEngine to simulate academic performance in the Lincoln Heights school drama simulation system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration (CONFIG)
**Location**: `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt` line ~1334

Added:
```javascript
ACADEMIC_SUBJECTS: ['Математика', 'Литература', 'История', 'Химия']
```

### 2. State Initialization (lcInit)
**Location**: `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt` line ~1567

Added:
```javascript
// academics tracking (Bell Curve Protocol, Phase 1)
L.academics = L.academics || { grades: {} };
if (!L.academics.grades || typeof L.academics.grades !== 'object') {
  L.academics.grades = {};
}
```

### 3. Character Properties (updateCharacterActivity)
**Location**: `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt` line ~2036

Added for each character:
```javascript
// aptitude: natural ability per subject (random 0.4-0.9)
// effort: work ethic per subject (random 0.4-0.9)
rec.aptitude = {};
rec.effort = {};
```

### 4. AcademicsEngine
**Location**: `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt` line ~6064

Created new engine with two methods:

#### calculateGrade(character, subject)
- **Inputs**: character object, subject name
- **Formula**: 
  - Base performance = aptitude (50%) + effort (30%) + mood-adjusted (20%)
  - Add randomness (±0.15)
  - Convert to 5-point scale (1.0 - 5.0)
- **Returns**: grade (number, rounded to 1 decimal)

#### recordGrade(characterName, subject, grade)
- **Inputs**: character name, subject, grade value
- **Action**: Stores grade in `L.academics.grades[characterName][subject][]` with timestamp
- **Structure**: Each grade is `{grade: number, turn: number}`

### 5. LivingWorld Integration
**Location**: `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt` line ~5476

Modified `runOffScreenCycle()`:
- Added 20% probability academic test generation during time jumps
- When triggered, randomly selects a subject
- Generates and records grades for all active characters

## Data Structure

### State Structure
```javascript
L.academics = {
  grades: {
    "Максим": {
      "Математика": [
        { grade: 4.5, turn: 10 },
        { grade: 3.8, turn: 25 }
      ],
      "История": [
        { grade: 4.2, turn: 15 }
      ]
    },
    "Хлоя": {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Character Properties
```javascript
character = {
  // ... existing properties ...
  aptitude: {
    "Математика": 0.67,    // 67% natural ability
    "Литература": 0.77,
    "История": 0.46,
    "Химия": 0.50
  },
  effort: {
    "Математика": 0.55,    // 55% work ethic
    "Литература": 0.41,
    "История": 0.85,
    "Химия": 0.43
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Suite: `tests/test_academics_engine.js`
- **Total Tests**: 30
- **All Passing**: ✅
- **Coverage**:
  1. CONFIG validation
  2. State initialization
  3. Character property initialization
  4. Engine structure verification
  5. Grade calculation logic
  6. Grade recording mechanics
  7. LivingWorld integration
  8. Grade distribution analysis

### Demo: `tests/demo_academics_engine.js`
Interactive demonstration showing:
- Student profile generation with varying aptitudes/efforts
- Semester-based test cycles
- Grade accumulation over time
- Final performance rankings
- Integration with LivingWorld time progression

## Compatibility

All existing tests still pass:
- ✅ `test_living_world.js` - Living World Engine
- ✅ `test_qualia_engine.js` - Qualia/Phenomenal Core
- ✅ `test_russian_enhancements.js` - Russian language patterns

## Key Features

1. **Individualized Performance**: Each character has unique aptitude/effort profiles
2. **Mood Influence**: Current emotional state affects performance
3. **Randomness**: Simulates day-to-day variation in test performance
4. **Accumulation**: Grades build up over time, creating academic history
5. **Off-screen Events**: Tests happen automatically during time jumps
6. **Multi-subject**: Tracks performance across 4 different subjects

## Files Modified

1. `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt` (+89 lines)
   - CONFIG update
   - State initialization
   - Character initialization
   - AcademicsEngine implementation
   - LivingWorld integration

## Files Created

1. `tests/test_academics_engine.js` (371 lines)
   - Comprehensive test suite with 30 tests
   
2. `tests/demo_academics_engine.js` (246 lines)
   - Interactive demonstration of full functionality

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ Characters have aptitude and effort defined for each subject
✅ L.academics.grades accumulates grades for all characters
✅ Existing engine functionality preserved (all tests pass)
✅ Academic tests generate periodically during off-screen time
✅ Grade calculation based on aptitude, effort, mood, and randomness
✅ Grades properly recorded with timestamps

## Next Steps (Phase 2 - Future)

Potential enhancements for future iterations:
- Academic rivalry mechanics (competition for GPA)
- Grade-based goals ("I need to improve my math grade")
- Social status effects from academic performance
- Study groups and peer tutoring
- Teacher favoritism mechanics
- Cheating/copying detection
- Academic pressure → stress → qualia effects
