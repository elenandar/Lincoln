# Omega Protocol - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Omega Protocol is a final verification test designed to provide irrefutable proof of how all system engines work in harmony when processing a single complex event. Unlike stress tests that validate stability, this test documents the internal workings of the system at the micro-level.

## Implementation Date

**2025-10-12**

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Omega Protocol Test Script (`tests/omega_protocol_test.js`)

A comprehensive test script that executes the following tasks:

#### Task 1: Warmup Simulation
- Runs a 500-turn simulation to "warm up" the world
- Creates initial history, relationships, and social statuses
- Generates diverse character profiles with different GPA levels and social standings
- Saves the baseline state to `omega_base_state.json`

**Configuration:**
- 8 characters with diverse profiles
- Character profiles include:
  - Максим: outcast with low GPA (2.1)
  - Хлоя: leader with high GPA (4.8)
  - 6 additional secondary characters
- Random social events (1-2 per turn)
- Academic events (20% chance per turn)

#### Task 2: Complex Event Injection

On turn 501, the test injects a carefully designed complex event:

**Event**: "Максим, имеющий низкий средний балл и статус изгоя, публично обвинил Хлоя, у которого высокий средний балл и статус лидера, в списывании на последнем экзамене по Химии."

**Translation**: "Максим, having a low GPA and outcast status, publicly accused Хлоя, who has a high GPA and leader status, of cheating on the last Chemistry exam."

This event is multi-faceted:
- Social dynamics (outcast vs leader)
- Academic implications (cheating accusation)
- Public nature (affects reputation)
- Specific subject (Chemistry)

#### Task 3: Detailed Engine Tracking

The test captures before/after snapshots for all major engines:

1. **InformationEngine / Qualia State**
   - Tracks phenomenal state changes
   - Monitors: somatic_tension, valence, focus_aperture, energy_level

2. **MoodEngine**
   - Captures mood changes
   - Records mood reasons

3. **RelationsEngine**
   - Tracks relationship value changes
   - Monitors bidirectional relationships

4. **AcademicsEngine**
   - Monitors academic effort changes
   - Tracks cheating verification initiation

5. **SocialEngine**
   - Captures social capital changes
   - Monitors status shifts (leader, member, outcast)

6. **GoalsEngine**
   - Detects new goal generation
   - Tracks goal content and timing

7. **LoreEngine**
   - Evaluates legendary event potential
   - Records new legend creation

### 2. Generated Output

#### `OMEGA_PROTOCOL_REPORT.md`

A comprehensive markdown report that provides:

- **Executive Summary**: Event details and context
- **System State**: StateVersion tracking
- **Engine-by-Engine Analysis**: Before/after comparison tables
- **Summary Section**: Overall engine activation status
- **Conclusion**: Verification status

The report format is structured for readability and includes:
- Tables comparing before/after states
- Delta (Δ) calculations
- Change indicators (✓, →, ↑)
- Impact level assessments

#### `omega_base_state.json`

A complete JSON snapshot of the simulation state after 500 turns, including:
- All character states
- All relationships
- All goals
- All rumors
- All academic records
- All social structures
- All legends

**Note**: This file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore` as it's regenerated on each test run.

### 3. Infrastructure Improvements

#### `.gitignore`

Added to exclude:
- Generated state files (`omega_base_state.json`)
- Node modules
- Build artifacts
- IDE files
- OS files

## How to Run

```bash
node tests/omega_protocol_test.js
```

**Expected Runtime**: ~10-15 seconds for 500-turn warmup + event processing

**Generated Files**:
1. `omega_base_state.json` - Baseline state (not committed)
2. `OMEGA_PROTOCOL_REPORT.md` - Detailed analysis report (committed)

## What the Test Demonstrates

The Omega Protocol test successfully demonstrates:

### ✅ Correct System Integration
- All engines process events through UnifiedAnalyzer
- StateVersion tracking works correctly
- Engine coordination is seamless

### ✅ Micro-Level Traceability
- Every engine's contribution is captured
- Before/after states are documented
- Change detection works at fine granularity

### ✅ Event Processing Pipeline
- Events flow through all relevant engines
- Each engine makes independent decisions
- System state evolves coherently

### ✅ Documentation Quality
- Report is structured and readable
- Technical details are preserved
- Non-technical summary is provided

## Technical Details

### StateVersion Tracking

The test verifies that:
- StateVersion is initialized correctly
- StateVersion increments when state changes occur
- StateVersion remains stable when no changes occur

### Engine Activation

- Which engines were activated by the event
- What changes each engine made
- Impact level (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

### Data Preservation

The test ensures:
- All state is preserved in JSON format
- State can be loaded for analysis
- State size is reasonable (~75-100 KB)
