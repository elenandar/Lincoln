# Living World Engine Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the **Living World Engine** (–î–≤–∏–∂–æ–∫ –ñ–∏–≤–æ–≥–æ –ú–∏—Ä–∞), a sophisticated system that enables NPC autonomy and proactive actions during "off-screen" time periods. This transforms the Lincoln narrative engine from purely reactive to dynamic and living.

## Implementation Date

2025-10-10

## Architecture Components

### 1. The Conductor (Simulation Trigger)

**Files Modified:**
- `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt` (TimeEngine.advance)
- `Output v16.0.8.patched.txt` (Integration point)

**Implementation:**

Modified `TimeEngine.advance()` to return time jump information:
```javascript
{
  type: 'ADVANCE_TO_NEXT_MORNING' | 'ADVANCE_DAY' | 'NONE',
  duration: 'night' | 'day' | 'days',
  days: number // for ADVANCE_DAY
}
```

Modified `TimeEngine.processSemanticAction()` to store time jump data:
- `ADVANCE_TO_NEXT_MORNING`: Sets `lastTimeJump` with type and duration
- `ADVANCE_DAY`: Sets `lastTimeJump` with type, duration, and days count
- Other actions: No time jump stored

Integrated in `Output.txt` after text analysis:
```javascript
const timeJump = LC.TimeEngine.advance();
if (timeJump.type === 'ADVANCE_TO_NEXT_MORNING' || timeJump.type === 'ADVANCE_DAY') {
  LC.LivingWorld.runOffScreenCycle(timeJump);
  LC.lcSys({ text: `–°–∏–º—É–ª—è—Ü–∏—è –º–∏—Ä–∞ –∑–∞ –∫–∞–¥—Ä–æ–º –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–∞ (${timeJump.duration}).`, level: 'director' });
}
```

### 2. The Actors (Decision-Making Logic)

**Files Modified:**
- `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt` (New LC.LivingWorld module)

**Implementation:**

Created `LC.LivingWorld` object with three main functions:

#### `runOffScreenCycle(timeJump)`
- Filters for ACTIVE characters (skips FROZEN)
- Iterates through each active character
- Calls `simulateCharacter()` for each
- Error-isolated (one character error doesn't break others)

#### `simulateCharacter(character)`
Implements the **Motivation Pyramid** with three priority levels:

**Priority 1: Active Goals**
- Checks `L.goals` for character's active goals
- If found: `action = { type: 'PURSUE_GOAL', goal, goalKey }`

**Priority 2: Strong Relationships**
- If no goals, checks `L.evergreen.relations[charName]`
- Finds strongest relationship with |value| ‚â• 30
- Positive: `action = { type: 'SOCIAL_POSITIVE', target, strength }`
- Negative: `action = { type: 'SOCIAL_NEGATIVE', target, strength }`

**Priority 3: Upcoming Events**
- If no goals/strong relations, checks `L.time.scheduledEvents`
- Events within 3 days: `action = { type: 'PREPARE_EVENT', event }`

**Mood Modifier:**
- Reads `L.character_status[charName].mood`
- Attaches mood to action for intensity calculation

### 3. The Script (Fact Generation)

**Files Modified:**
- `Library v16.0.8.patched.txt` (LC.LivingWorld.generateFact)

**Implementation:**

#### `generateFact(characterName, action)`
Converts decisions into state changes without generating text.

**Action Handlers:**

**PURSUE_GOAL:**
```javascript
character.flags['goal_progress_' + goalKey] += 0.25;
// Capped at 1.0
```

**SOCIAL_NEGATIVE:**
```javascript
modifier = -5; // Base: -5, ANGRY: -10, FRUSTRATED: -10
L.evergreen.relations[char1][char2] += modifier;
L.evergreen.relations[char2][char1] += modifier;
// Bidirectional, clamped to [-100, 100]
```

**SOCIAL_POSITIVE:**
```javascript
modifier = 5; // Base: +5, HAPPY: +8, EXCITED: +8
L.evergreen.relations[char1][char2] += modifier;
L.evergreen.relations[char2][char1] += modifier;
```

**GOSSIP:**
```javascript
// Spreads existing rumor to new character
rumor.knownBy.push(targetChar);
rumor.distortion += 0.1;
```

**PREPARE_EVENT:**
```javascript
character.flags['event_preparation_' + eventId] = true;
```

All actions increment `L.stateVersion` to invalidate context cache.

## Integration with Existing Systems

### RelationsEngine
- Uses same relation structure (`L.evergreen.relations`)
- Ensures nested object structure exists before modification
- Respects [-100, 100] bounds

### GoalsEngine
- Reads from `L.goals`
- Updates progress via character flags
- Filters for `status === 'active'`

### TimeEngine
- Reads `L.time.currentDay` and `scheduledEvents`
- No circular dependency (TimeEngine ‚Üí LivingWorld only)

### MoodEngine
- Reads from `L.character_status[charName].mood`
- Mood values affect action intensity
- Supported moods: HAPPY, SAD, ANGRY, EXCITED, FRUSTRATED, DETERMINED, etc.

### GossipEngine
- Can spread rumors via existing Propagator API
- Only spreads rumors character knows about
- Increments distortion on spread

### CharacterLifecycle
- Respects character status (ACTIVE vs FROZEN)
- Skips FROZEN characters entirely
- Works with all character types (MAIN, SECONDARY, EXTRA)

## Documentation

### Files Modified:
- `SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md`

**New Section:** 3.10 Living World Engine (NPC Autonomy)

**Content:**
- Overview and philosophy
- The Conductor (trigger mechanism)
- The Actors (decision-making)
- The Script (fact generation)
- State structure
- Integration with other systems
- Practical examples (3 detailed scenarios)
- Design philosophy
- Testing coverage

**Updated Sections:**

- Have agency and pursue own objectives
- World evolves during off-screen time

### Fact-Based, Not Narrative
- No text generation during simulation
- Only atomic state changes
- Player discovers consequences naturally

### Integration-First
- Uses existing engine APIs
- No duplicate logic or state
- Respects all constraints

### Performance-Conscious
- Only runs on significant time jumps
- Skips frozen/inactive characters
- Minimal computational overhead
- Error-isolated per character

   - Alliance formation
   - Conflict escalation

4. **Dynamic Events:**
   - NPCs creating events
   - Event cancellation/modification
   - Event chain reactions

5. **Memory System:**
