# Lincoln v16.0.8-compat6d Script Audit

## Methodology
- Re-ran a manual audit of Library, Input, Output, and Context modules with an emphasis on cross-module contracts, state flows, and command-cycle safety.
- Stepped through recap/epoch, evergreen, anti-echo, and SYS queue paths to confirm flag transitions and side effects across modifier stages.
- Simulated common commands (undo, continue, cadence, evergreen toggles) by reading the handler implementations to validate turn logic and queue behaviour.

## Compatibility Assessment
- All runtime modifiers still self-identify as `16.0.8-compat6d` and push the shared data version into `LC.DATA_VERSION` on every invocation, keeping mixed-loader environments on a consistent schema.【F:Context v16.0.8.patched.txt†L10-L49】【F:Input v16.0.8.patched.txt†L10-L208】【F:Output v16.0.8.patched.txt†L10-L91】
- The Library bootstrap merges host-provided configuration with built-in defaults before exposing helpers, preserving backwards compatibility while respecting overrides for limits and features.【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L28-L118】【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L1727-L1767】
- Shared helpers (`LC.replyStop`, `LC.Commands`, `LC.buildCtxPreview`, evergreen/anti-echo utilities) remain guarded with optional chaining and Map wrappers so that missing modules degrade gracefully instead of throwing runtime errors.【F:Input v16.0.8.patched.txt†L25-L208】【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L58-L220】

## Logic Consistency Checks
- Command cycle flags now propagate correctly: `clearCommandFlags` forwards the `preserveCycle` hint to the Library facade, allowing `/undo` and similar flows to keep `__cmdCyclePending` alive when requested.【F:Input v16.0.8.patched.txt†L71-L88】【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L83-L97】
- Recap/Epoch orchestration remains coherent—Input toggles `doRecap`/`doEpoch`, Output clears them after generating drafts, and the Library owns cadence, auto-offer logic, and draft persistence with turn guards.【F:Input v16.0.8.patched.txt†L303-L323】【F:Output v16.0.8.patched.txt†L48-L133】【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L118-L166】【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L1400-L1552】
- Turn bookkeeping and retry detection continue to rely on Library helpers (`detectInputType`, `shouldIncrementTurn`, `incrementTurn`), preventing inadvertent turn bumps on command or retry paths and warning when invariants would break.【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L452-L516】【F:Output v16.0.8.patched.txt†L97-L132】

## Bugs & Conflicts Identified
- **Command cycle preservation (fixed):** `clearCommandFlags` previously ignored the `preserveCycle` option and always cleared `__cmdCyclePending`, so chained command handlers lost their bypass state. Passing the hint through to `LC.Flags.clearCmd` keeps multi-step flows on the command path.【F:Input v16.0.8.patched.txt†L71-L88】【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L83-L97】
- **Silent `/continue` confirmation (fixed):** `replyStopSilent` emptied the SYS queue even when `LC.Drafts.applyPending` enqueued success notices, causing `/continue` to apply drafts without user feedback. The helper now supports `keepQueue`, and the handler flushes stale entries before invoking the drafts API so Output can surface the confirmation block.【F:Input v16.0.8.patched.txt†L98-L106】【F:Input v16.0.8.patched.txt†L317-L323】【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L118-L166】【F:Output v16.0.8.patched.txt†L70-L91】
- **Observation:** `stampCommandSysMessage` remains unused; if future work needs stamped SYS replay outside the command cycle, wire it into `replyStop` to leverage Output’s duplicate filter.【F:Input v16.0.8.patched.txt†L59-L76】【F:Output v16.0.8.patched.txt†L26-L49】

## Functional Verification
- **Command surface:** `/evergreen`, `/antiecho`, `/events`, `/alias`, `/story`, `/cards`, `/ctx`, `/retry`, and `/cadence` continue to validate arguments, route through Library utilities, and respond with SYS-formatted text without incrementing story turns.【F:Input v16.0.8.patched.txt†L327-L520】
- **Draft acceptance UX:** `/continue` now relays draft acceptance feedback via Output’s command branch, ensuring players see “✅ Draft saved …” confirmations when recaps or epochs are stored.【F:Input v16.0.8.patched.txt†L317-L323】【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L118-L166】【F:Output v16.0.8.patched.txt†L70-L91】
- **Context composition & evergreen cadence:** `LC.composeContextOverlay` and evergreen analyzers respect configuration caps and degrade gracefully when upstream data is missing, keeping partial functionality intact on degraded hosts.【F:Context v16.0.8.patched.txt†L34-L49】【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L763-L1515】【F:Library v16.0.8.patched.txt†L182-L220】

## Recommendations
- Add lightweight integration tests (or a scripted harness) for command-cycle toggles and the `/continue` draft flow so SYS queue regressions are caught early.
- Consider wiring `stampCommandSysMessage` into `replyStop` when multi-message command responses are introduced, enabling Output’s dedupe guard for queued SYS lines.
